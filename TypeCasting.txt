Q17. What is Type casting in Java?
Ans.When we assign a value of one data type to the diô€ƒ¡erent data type then these two data types may not be compatible and needs a conversion. If
the data types are compatible (for example assigning int value to long) then java does automatic conversion and does not require casting. However if
the data types are not compatible then they need to be casted for conversion.
For example:
//here in the brackets we have mentioned long keyword, this is casting
double num = 10001.99;
long num2 = (long)num;
