Serialization 
--------------------------
1.. What is Serialization and deserialization?

2. How can we save & restore object data from file?

3. What is the use of ObjectOutputStream & ObjectInputStream classes? 

4. What are the rules we must follow in serialization and in deserialization?

5. When will we get NotSerializableException? 

6. What is the use of java.io.Serializable interface?
	1) Why Serializable interface does not have methods?
	2) Why Serializable interface is called marker interface?

7. Explain all steps involved in object serialization?

8. Explain all steps involved in object deserialization?

9. Why file extension in which we are saving object data should be ".ser" can it be ".txt"?

10. What is the information stored in .ser file?

11. When will ois.readObjed() method throws ClassNotFoundException?

12. When will ois.readObject() method throws Invalid ClassException?


13. What is the use of serialVersionUID variable?
	1) What is serialVersionUID, who will create it in class file? 
	2) On what basis compiler generates serialVersionUID value?
	3) If we add or remove class members will serialVersionUID value also changed?
	4) What is the use of serialver command, where is it available?
	5) For what type of class only serialVersionUID is generated?
	6) Can we create serialVersionUID variable in a class explicitly? 
	7) What should we do to complete deserialization successfully even if the class is modified after serialization?
	8) What is the complete syntax of serialVersionUID?
	9) Is it possible to remove private, static, final keywords in creating serialVersionUID variable?

14. Assume the variable serialVersionUID is created in the class by programmer, serialization is completed, then will deserialization is complete in the blow cases?
	1). New variable is added in this object class? 
	2) Serialized variable is removed from this object class?
	3) Serialized variable's data type is changed? 
	4) class is derived from a class
	5) New method is added

15. What is a transient keyword & what is the use of it?
	1) How can we stop saving object data?
	2) To what variables transient keyword is allowed?
	3) Is there any use of declaring static variable as transient?

16. What are the variables not participate in Serialization and deserialization? 

17. What is the value stored in transient variable & static variable in deserialization?

18. What is the correct procedure to store & read confidential data of an object from file?

19. Let say object has 100 variables, among them how can we save only 10 variables, & among the saved 10 variables how can we read only 5 variables?

20. The meaning of customizing serialization?
	1) What is the purpose of private writeObject() Text readObject() methods? & private
	2) What is the purpose of Externalizable interface? 
	3) What are the differences between Serializable and Externalizable Interfaces?
	4) Is Externalizable interface a marker interface?
	5) Explain the use of Externalizable interface methods? 6). Who will execute private writeObject()& write External() methods, at what time?
	7) Who will execute private readObject() & readExternal() methods, at what time?

21. Explain various steps involved in serializing IS-A relation object?
	1) If super class is Serializable, will the complete object graph is saved & restored?
	2) If super class is not Serializable, will the complete object graph is saved & restored? What is the rule we must follow if super class is not Serializable type?
	3) Why root super class should not be subclass of Serializable interface?
	4) Why Collection interface is not subclass of Serializable & Cloneable?
	5) If super class is a Serializable type how can we stop serializing subclass object?

22. Explain various steps involved in serializing HAS-A relation object?
	1) To serialize an object, is it mandatory that its internal object also should be Serializable type? 
	2) How can we save an object if its internal object is not Serializable type?

23. How can we save & restore multiple objects from a file? 

24. What are the different ways to create an object?
