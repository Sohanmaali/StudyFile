Q16. What are Java Packages? What’s the signi􀃕cance of packages?
Ans: In Java, package is a collection of classes and interfaces which are bundled together as they are related to each other. Use of packages helps
developers to modularize the code and group the code for proper re-use. Once code has been packaged in Packages, it can be imported in other
classes and used.


Q20. Does Importing a package imports its sub-packages as well in Java?
Ans: In java, when a package is imported, its sub-packages aren’t imported and developer needs to import them separately if required.
For example, if a developer imports a package university.*, all classes in the package named university are loaded but no classes from the subpackage
are loaded. To load the classes from its sub-package ( say department), developer has to import it explicitly as follows:
import university.department.*

39 ) What are packages in java?
Package is a mechanism to group related classes ,interfaces and enums in to a single module.
Package can be declared using the following statement :
Syntax : package <package-name>
Coding Convention : package name should be declared in small letters.
package statement defines the namespace.
The main use of package is
1) To resolve naming conflicts
2) For visibility control : We can define classes and interfaces that are not accessible outside the
class.
40) Can we have more than one package statement in source file ?
We can’t have more than one package statement in source file. In any java program there can be atmost
only 1 package statement. We will get compilation error if we have more than one package statement in
source file.
41) Can we define package statement after import statement in java?
We can’t define package statement after import statement in java. package statement must be the first
statement in source file. We can have comments before the package statement.
