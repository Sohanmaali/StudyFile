Q6. What are Loops in Java? What are three types of loops?
Ans: Looping is used in programming to execute a statement or a block of statement repeatedly. There are three types of loops in Java:
1) For Loops
For loops are used in java to execute statements repeatedly for a given number of times. For loops are used when number of times to execute the
statements is known to programmer.
2) While Loops
While loop is used when certain statements need to be executed repeatedly until a condition is ful􀃕lled. In while loops, condition is checked 􀃕rst
before execution of statements.
3) Do While Loops
Do While Loop is same as While loop with only di􀃡erence that condition is checked after execution of block of statements. Hence in case of do while
loop, statements are executed at least once.
Q7: What is an in􀃕nite Loop? How in􀃕nite loop is declared?
Ans: An in􀃕nite loop runs without any condition and runs in􀃕nitely. An in􀃕nite loop can be broken by de􀃕ning any breaking logic in the body of the
statement blocks.
In􀃕nite loop is declared as follows:
for (;;)
{
// Statements to execute
// Add any loop breaking logic
}
Q8. What is the di􀃡erence between continue and break statement?
Ans: break and continue are two important keywords used in Loops. When a break keyword is used in a loop, loop is broken instantly while when
continue keyword is used, current iteration is broken and loop continues with next iteration.
In below example, Loop is broken when counter reaches 4.
for (counter = 0; counter & lt; 10; counter++) system.out.println(counter); if (counter == 4) { break;} }
In the below example when counter reaches 4, loop jumps to next iteration and any statements after the continue keyword are skipped for current
iteration.
for (counter = 0; counter < 10; counter++) system.out.println(counter); if (counter == 4) { continue;}system.out.println(“This will not get printed
when counter is 4”);}

Q13. What is default switch case? Give example.
Ans: In a switch statement, default case is executed when no other switch condition matches. Default case is an optional case .It can be declared only
once all other switch cases have been coded.
In the below example, when score is not 1 or 2, default case is used.
public class switchExample { int score = 4; public static void main(String args[]) { switch (score) { case 1: system.out.println(“Score
is 1”); break; case 2: system.out.println(“Score is 2”); break; default: system.out.println(“Default
Case”); } }}

Q39. What’s the purpose of using Break in each case of Switch Statement?
Ans: Break is used after each case (except the last one) in a switch so that code breaks after the valid case and doesn’t 􀃖ow in the proceeding cases
too.
If break isn’t used after each case, all cases after the valid case also get executed resulting in wrong results.
