9. Why return type is not allowed for constructor? 

10. If we place return type in constructor declaration, is it leads to CE?

11. Can we define a method with class name, if yes, is it recommended, if no why?

28. How can we execute overloaded constructors of a class without creating new object?

29. What is the difference between this() & this(5)?

30. How non-static variables will be differentiated from one object to another object in a constructor in its initialization logic? 

31. How can we initialize non-static variables in different instances with different values at the time of object creation & after object creation?

32. Explain about setXXX() & getXXX() methods?

Constructor overloading & chaining Interview Questions
---------------------------------------------------------

1. What is constructor overloading? 

2. What is constructor chaining?

3. Can we override constructor? 

4. If we overload constructors, which constructor is executed?

5. When should we overload constructor? 

6. What are the rules we must follow in overloading a constructor?

8. How can we chain subclass overloaded constructors? 

9. When we invoke a constructor using this() or using super(), will new object created?

10. Explain this() execution flow Text

11. Write a program to count number of objects created from a class?

12. What are the rules we must follow in constructor chaining? 
	1) Why this() or super() call should be placed as first statement in a constructor?
	2) Can we place both this() & super() in the a constructor? a constructor?
	3) Can we place this() or super() twice in
	4) Can we place this() or super() in a method?
	5) Can we place this() call in the same matching parameter constructor?
	6) When will you get CE: recursive constructor call? 
	7) For example in a no-arg constructor, why we cannot place this() call but we can place constructor call with new keyword?
	8) In a subclass, why we should not place this() in all constructors, at least one constructor should contain super()?


=============================================================================
19)What is constructor in java ?
constructor is a special method used to initialize objects in java
we use constructors to initialize all variables in the class when an object is created. As and when an object
is created it is initialized automatically with the help of constructor in java.
We have two types of constructors
Default Constructor
Parameterized Constructor

50) Can we create constructor in abstract class ?
We can create constructor in abstract class , it does’nt give any compilation error. But when we cannot
instantiate class there is no use in creating a constructor for abstract class.
